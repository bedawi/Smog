# Smog
Android App to warn user of toxic air pollution at his current location.

Please check my website for detailed information on the progress of development: https://benjamindahlhoff.de/category/apps/smog-app/

At current stage the application reads data from the Stuttgart Air Quality Project "luftdaten.info" and presents them in a list of stations. More data sources are to be embedded.

The overall aim is to create an app which shows the air quality (data) in the vincinity of the user and interprets the values by calculating the air quality index.

Furthermore the application should allow the user to pick stations to observe. This is a useful feature for people who run a DIY weather station.
